TITLE:
Open multiple URLs with one click!

DETAILS:
Time-saver for those who need to repeatedly open the same set of URLs.
For example: Investors and finance professionals who open the same
set of stock charts every day, or reporters who follow several
news feeds on a daily basis.

The extension's options page allows you to enter and edit the list
of URLs you want to open. The URLs will then be opened following
the same order as the list. You can edit the order just by dragging
and dropping the rows of your list, and you can delete any of the 
URLs you have entered.

Then, when you click the multi-tab icon to the right of the
address field in your Chrome browser, the URLs you have saved
will immediately open in different tabs.

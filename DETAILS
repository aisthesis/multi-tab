Time-saver for those who need to repeatedly open the same set of URLs. For example: Investors and finance professionals
who open the same set of stock charts every day, or reporters who follow several news feeds on a daily basis.

The extension's options page allows you to enter and edit the list of URLs you want to open. The URLs will then be
opened in the same order as they appear in your list. You can edit their order by dragging and dropping rows, and you
can delete any URL when it is no longer needed.

Once you have set up your list, you can click the multi-tab icon to the right of the address field in your Chrome
browser to immediately open all of the URLs you have saved.
